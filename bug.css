The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
 color: purple; 
}

#myDiv.container div {  
  color: yellow;
}
```

The issue arises when trying to understand the order of precedence and how to target nested elements and elements with multiple classes and IDs. It's easy to misinterpret the cascade and the selector specificity and thus not get the expected result.
